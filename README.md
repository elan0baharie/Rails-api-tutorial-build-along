Following along with tutorial e-book at http://apionrails.icalialabs.com/book

Tutorial github: https://github.com/kurenn/market_place_api

The material uses quite a few dated and/or depricated procedures.

Built up to chapter 3, where it is now stuck unable to install gems required in tutorial.

Removed the route constraints as they were causing errors.

Have all post/patch tests currently commented, as we could not adapt them and make them pass. Throwing errors about improper number of params and no route errors.
